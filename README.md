# AI Chatbot
An intelligent chatbot using AI in Python Language

# Concept
This chatbot is based on seq2seq model, which is powered by neural network and features a encoder and a decoder for the purpose of interpreting the data.

# Installation
* Navigate to Source Code folder
* Download and extract the zip file from weights folder.
* Run the below command - <br />

      python chatbot.py “seq2seq_model.ckpt-43000.data-00000-of-00001”
    
   
# Train your own model
I have trained my model to 10 epochs only. But you can train as much as you like. The more you train, more proficient the bot will be.

## Pre-requisites
    Python > 3.8
    Anaconda Distribution

## Getting started
* First install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution">Anaconda Distribution</a> and create a virtual environment.
* Activate the environment and install the following depensencies - 

      pip install numpy
      pip install tensorflow

* Download the movie-corpus dataset(Data Set.rar) from Source Code folder. You can use any other dataset too, but you have to feed the data to model accordingly. 

## Training model 
* Edit no of epochs in the chatbot.py file and run the below command -  
    
      python chatbot.py
    
* Wait for the model to be trained and run the python file along with the trained data.

## Bonus
You can use <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/"> Google Colab </a> to train your model. You can also <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/signup">visit</a> to upgrade your plan for fast training time.
